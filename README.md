    <h1>Week 1</h1>
   <h2>Dataset Theme</h2>
    <p>The theme I chose for my portfolio is jazz and blues music. The artist of my first piece is Bill Withers, and the second is Wilbur Schwandt and Fabian Andre. I chose to write about these pieces as they are both great examples of the genre and showcase the emotional depth and musicality that jazz and blues can offer.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Potential challenges that could arise when working with music data is the complexity of finding music formats that will be compatible with musescore's software as it can be particular about this. 
      Another struggle is the issues around copyright. This means that in some scenarios we are forced to work with cover versions of songs which might not exactly replicate the original, and this could cause confusion between the two pieces, making it harder to find the correct one when searching online.
      Thankfully both of my pieces are available on Spotify, meaning they are easily accessible and I am able to find out details and statistics. 
      While there may be challenges in doing this type of work, I am excited to delve deeper into the pieces I have chosen through analysing and curating them.</p>

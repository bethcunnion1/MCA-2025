    <h2>Dataset Theme</h2>
    <p>The theme I chose for my portfolio is jazz music. The piece of music I am working with is 'Just the Two of Us', by Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr.
      Analysing and transcribing this piece in musescore was simple enough to do, as note input was rapid and the undo/redo functions were very helpful to immediately edit my score as I worked.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Potential challenges that could arise when working with music data is the complexity of finding music formats that will be compatible with musescore's software as it can be particular about this. 
      Another struggle is the issues around copyright. This means that in some scenarios we are forced to work with cover versions of songs which might not exactly replicate the original, and this could cause confusion between the two pieces, making it harder to find the correct one when searching online.
      Thankfully most of the pieces used throughout my portfolio are available on Spotify, meaning they are easily accessible and I am able to find out details and statistics. 
      While there may be challenges in doing this type of work, I am excited to delve deeper into the pieces I have chosen through analysing and curating them.</p>

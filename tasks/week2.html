      <h2>Using musescore</h2>
      Using musescore to transcribe this piece worked well as it was simple to navigate and find the tools I wanted to use, for example the text and note input. Another useful element was that the score would update immediately when adding notes. Once grasping these controls it was straightforward enough to edit my score. There were many helpful shortcuts to use, for example 'T' to add a tied note. These came in handy throughout the process but need some getting used to.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      Despite these positives, there were also notable challenges when using this software. As a beginner, it took a bit of getting used to and learning when to drag and drop items or select them in the properties panel. Fine-tuning spacing and specific note alignment were not always simple to achieve due to the sensitivity of the cursor when placing notes, and took a few tries to make sure they were in the correct positions.
